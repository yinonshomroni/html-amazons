					<h1>Story & season arc</h1>
					<br/>
						<p>In a near alternative future Israel is still recovering from the outbreak of an aggressive virus, which is contagious and deadly only to men. After thousands of deaths, the Israeli government has managed to contain the virus using legislation and enforcement: men (16 years old and up) must remain in home quarantine or quarantine in facilities around the country. The public space is entirely emptied of men while women literally rule society.</p>
						<p>In a world that has changed under the pandemic, the protagonists of this story are the policewomen in charge of investigating and hunting down the killer, apparently a man (as per usual with serial killers). This is a world in which grievances and conflicts between the sexes rise to the forefront, where women, who can infect men and cause their deaths, are now more threatening than ever. But even more so, an old, masculine fear, always bubbling beneath the surface, begins to arise – <b/>that woman can get along quite well without men.<b/></p>

				<p>Talia Shevo is a rookie patrol officer who never meant to end up at this job. Her dad, a cop who meant everything to her, died of the virus. Since then, her grieving mother has been unstable and refuses to leave her house,  sometimes even her bed. Without Talia’s hands-on help and care, she can’t function to a point it seems their mother-daughter relationship is being fully reversed. Sensitive and dreamy and empathetic, Talia sees her job with the police as a way to make a living and financially support her home.  In a deeper sense – she feels that the police station brings her closer to her father and the man he was, as if she’s carrying on his mission. Her Achilles-heel is her clinical depression which she learned to master with the help of a special medication, a ketamine-based nose spray that helps her keep it together.</p>
				<p>Talia is paired up to patrol with Detective Devora Kogan, an experienced policewoman who just arrived at the Yarkon Precinct so that she could be closer to her teenage daughter Melody (16), who holds a grudge against her for years of absence. It’s quickly evident that Talia and Devora see the world differently. Devora’s trademark is her toughness and high confidence.  She sees sentimentality as weakness and the virus killing off men as nature’s poetic justice. Talia, on the other hand, misses the tight embrace of a man. The broad-shouldered type, who can lift her up, effortlessly.</p>

				<p>The pandemic has a drastic impact on every-day life, but what had seemed at first like a world-gone-crazy has gelled into a permanent reality. A status quo where most men and women have learned to accept the  quarantine decree and the necessity to live separately from one another, though it’s clear that this is still an ongoing process and many still struggle During their first shift together, Devora and Talia handle petty cases like calls about wild boars at the local shopping center, a pit that formed in the road at the center of town, and a man who barricaded and locked himself inside his wife’s apartment refusing to leave for a quarantine motel for men. The man, Jacky, is desperate not to go to the motel, and is prepared to use violence and even threatens suicide. After Devorah’s procedural negotiation attempts fail and violent escalation seems imminent -- Talia, backed against a wall and threatened by Jacky intuitively tries a softer more personal approach and disarms the angry desperate man by offering him her help to move to a private quarantine facility. Her empathy wins him over and he agrees. Devorah is angered by her dangerous recklessness and personal involvement but at the same time impressed by the sharpness under pressure, good instincts and sensitivity shown by Talia, whom at first came across as just another provincial recruit.</p>

								<p>When a report about a missing local girl comes in, Udi (49), the station chief (who, like many other officers, does his job from quarantine), decides to hand the case over to Devora as lead detective, along with Talia, who’s still assigned to her. Dina Abramov, a 16-year-old redhead, is a model student who always toed the line, a good girl who lives with her hairdresser mother in Afula. She was last seen waiting for a ride home from the gas station where she worked. Devora suspects that Dina ran away to her father, Gabriel, who has been living in France with his family since his divorce. Ever since the borders closed, a sophisticated clandestine smuggling network to countries where the plague hasn’t hit has been operating, with which Devorah is well-acquainted. At first, it seems all evidence points at Devora’s theory to be correct, but when a young girl’s hand is found inside the corpse of a wild boar run over in the shopping center, all bets are off and the detectives realize they must consider other options.</p>	
								<p>The whole city is abuzz about the hand found inside the boar, rumors spreads about the hand actually belonging to Dina. You can’t keep a secret like that quiet, especially not in a small and familiar community like Afula. When Dina’s mother finds out and demands answers, things between the family and investigators get tense. Gabriel, Dina’s father, leaves Paris and makes his way to Israeldespite all the warnings and risks. he wants to make sure his daughter is found. Meanwhile, Devorah discovers, through her secret connections that Dina never left the country.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="ovcolumn">
								<p> The DNA tests of the hand found in the boar proves it didn’t belong to Dina but actually to another young woman, who also disappeared two months ago. As more details are revealed, a suspiciously similar picture begins to form about both cases. It now becomes clear that the girls were taken against their will and even though no bodies are yet to be found the detectives fear the worst for them.  The fact that men no longer roam free in the streets, and a witness’ account that the last person spotted speaking to Dina was a woman, lead Devora to a new theory. Just like many roles traditionally filled by men have been filled by women since the pandemic – could it be that in these new times, they should be looking for a female serial killer?</p>
								<p>Meanwhile, we follow Jacky [the man we met barricaded in his apartment] as he journeys to the public quarantine motel and realizes his fears have come true when he finds out that the motel – an upscale guesthouse on the banks of the Sea of Galilee – is, in fact, a fancy prison, separated into violent groups fighting over power and control. He inevitably falls victim to abuse and violence, but luckily, Zev (55), a psychologist in his previous life and an intelligent and empathetic man, comes to Jacky’s rescue and helps him understand how to slip under the gangs’ radar. Jacky discovers that Zev is a well-respected figure at the motel and known by all as the “therapist” as he informally treats the men as a psychologist and helps to moderate minor disputes. Many men come to see him for sessions and confide in him and reveal  details of their trouble in quarantine, their fantasies of freedom, and sometimes their violent and sexual fantasies, too.</p>

				<p>An investigation into a serial killer is rare in Afula, and Devora pushes Udi to release a public statement, but he refuses, fearing a media circus. Devora worries Udi doubts their ability to catch the killer. Frustrated, she begins making decisions on her own. The case deepens her belief that the virus is nature's way of eliminating violent men. Meanwhile, Talia struggles with the pressures of the investigation, turning to her anti-depressant nose spray, while feeling guilty about neglecting her ailing mother. When remains of a third girl are found, evidence suggests a link to "Hysteria," a radical group denying the male-virus quarantine. Devora and Talia refocus the investigation but find little evidence. Dina’s parents differ in coping: her mother visits a fortune teller, while her father grieves openly and blames the policewomen, questioning their competence. Talia connects with him over shared personal loss.</p>
				<p>Talia's drug dependency escalates as she stumbles upon a breakthrough, finding the car Dina was taken in, but the drug's effects destabilize her, and Devora has her hospitalized.</p>

			<div class="sttcolumn">
				<p>Acting on Talia’s hunch, Devora orders a search that uncovers Dina’s remains. The parents finally gain closure, and Talia starts recovering. News of a new victim, Jacky’s wife, complicates the case. Jacky refuses to cooperate, only speaking to Talia. During the interrogation, Talia learns that only Zev, who can sneak out of the motel, knew about Jacky’s hidden money. The police discover the money is gone, and upon reaching the motel, they find Jacky stabbed and Zev missing.</p>		
				<br/>
				<p>A search of Zev's room reveals Hysteria materials and disguises, indicating he deceived everyone. Devora deduces that Zev fled to the Gilboa forests, a place he knows well. In a final confrontation in the forest, Talia faces Zev alone, nearly succumbing to his grip. However, through teamwork, the policewomen subdue him, bringing a bittersweet sense of justice to Talia.</p>
