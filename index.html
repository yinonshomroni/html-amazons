					<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p> Barely a year after a deadly virus began targeting men across the Middle East, claiming thousands of lives, the entire region surrounding the town of Afula is now under quarantine. Men live in complete isolation, while women—immune to the mysterious virus—have taken control and are literally ruling the world.</p>
						<p> At the Afula central police station, Talia Shabo, a troubled yet sensitive twenty-something rookie, is partnered with Devora Kogan, a tough-as-nails senior detective recently transferred from Tel Aviv. Together, they are assigned to investigate the disappearance of Dina, a local teenager suspected of fleeing the infected country.</p>
						<p> As more victims are discovered, their bodies found floating in nearby waters, Talia and Devora realize that a serial killer is at work in the seemingly peaceful pastoral landscape. In this new, unexpected, and original setting—where men are confined to quarantine and wild animals are invading human territories—Talia and Devora find themselves hunting a cruel, relentless monster, a predator that appears to be a product of a broken society that has lost its core truths and now faces a new kind of threat.</p>
