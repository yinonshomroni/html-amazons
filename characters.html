				<h2>Talia</h2>
					<p>Winner smile, youthful, looks younger than she is. She has a way with animals. Talia is a chronic apologizer. She’s insecure but still possesses a drive for life. Full of optimism and humanism. She was sheltered by her father her entire life. Now he’s gone and she’s not sure how to survive and make hard decisions. The hole he left behind is too vast. She carries huge guilt: she thinks she’s the one who infected him. This is what led her to search for relief through meds. In the day-to-day, she takes care of her mother Edna, who finds it difficult to function without the man who managed her life and refuses to leave their home. Talia is, in effect, Edna’s window to the outside world. Talia projects strength but the hunt for the killer has a gradually dizzying effect and demands emotional fortitude that she’s not sure she has.</p>

				<h2>Devorah</h2>
					<p>Cold, calculating and sharp. A woman of facts and common sense, who has trouble with people skills and expressing emotions. She’s cynical, blunt, and doesn’t get easily insulted. Devora has been devoted to her work for her entire life, always struggling for visibility in her workplace - a police force entirely controlled by men. From a young age, she took on “masculine” mannerisms, tough talk, and buttoned up attire that doesn’t give off a sexual or feminine vibe. When Devora was a young girl, she was sexually harassed by a friend of her family in the Ukraine. She never speaks of this abuse directly, but it led to her bleak worldview about men and their destructive violence. Her relationship with her daughter Melody is explosive and full of challenges. During her first years of motherhood, Devora escaped into her work, while her ex-husband functioned as both father and mother. Now that Melody’s 17, Devora is trying to renew their relationship, but is constantly met with her daughter’s cold shoulder and distrust.</p>

				<h2>Melody</h2>
					<p>A high school student at a kibbutz dorm school. Melody is a gifted genius who does everything to escape fulfilling her potential. She’s an outsider, a rebel, a smart aleck. Her lack of relationship with her mother is what drives her distrust of women. She studies at a dorm school far away from her mother, where she’s lonely and has no friends after her best friend’s death. She finds refuge with the group he belonged to – “Hysteria” – a protest group that denies the existence of the men’s virus and alleges that it is being run by crony capitalism. Melody and Devorah’s relationship is a power clash between two strong women who find it difficult to accept the fact that they are made of the same stuff. The familiar tragedy of mothers and daughters.</p>

				<h2>Naomi</h2>
					<p>Talia’s best friend and a policewoman in the Afula police force. A responsible young woman who excels in everything she does. Virginal. Gives the impression of a diligent, hard worker with no personal life. Since the pandemic, she’s been promoted to managing office affairs at the police station. She’s having a secret affair with the station commander, Udi, who’s twenty years older. Her relationship with Udi only took off during the early days of the plague and Talia is the only one who knows about it. Over the season, Udi convinces Naomi to execute their escape plan which she tells no one else about.</p>

				<h2>Jacky</h2>
					<p>A bus driver before the plague hit who later became the main driver of the Jordan Rift Valley line. Jacky and his wife, who is a decade younger, tried to have children for years. This brought out a lot of Jacky’s frustration and rage, made him work long hours and look for financial solutions wherever he could. When the plague hit nearby Arab countries, Jacky accepted a dubious offer for a side job picking up rich Jordanian businessmen and joining a smuggling network that sneaks them into Israeli territory under false papers. All he needed to do was drive them and he got tens of thousands of dollars. Jacky hides this secret because he sees himself as responsible for the spread of the virus. </p>

				<h2>Zeev</h2>
					<p>A psychologist with extraordinary manipulative skills. Late 40’s. Smarter than average, has sharp senses. A straight man who can’t handle the sense of humiliation, inferiority, and castration that the new world brings. This awakens an old childhood trigger, when his difficult parents physically and emotionally abused him. Life at the motel brings out something he didn’t allow himself to be before – a violent predator.</p>
